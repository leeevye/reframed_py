# Reframed_py

A (really quite messy) version of the statistics plugin for Reframed, made with python.

I highly recommend you use [TheComet](https://github.com/TheComet)'s [Reframed](https://github.com/reframedultimate/ReFramed), but if you're a developer, you might enjoy looking through this repo.

This wouldn't be possible without [TheComet](https://github.com/TheComet), who wrote a majority of this code anyway!
