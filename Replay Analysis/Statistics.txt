OPENING DEFINITION (they call them punishes)
From https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lLJjKCcKoHPzs4wCECHu0E-PTmIXLfPB2wG9jn3qDY/edit#

Punishes
A punish starts when a player does damage to another player and that player is put in hitstun (or thrown).
A punish will continue until the player being punished lands on stage, is in control of their character and doesnâ€™t get hit or grabbed again for 45 frames.
A punish also ends when the opponent dies, these punishes are marked as killing punishes.
